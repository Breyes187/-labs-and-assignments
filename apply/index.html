<p>The text edior that I am using is called Atom</p>

<p>The way I created this webpage is by simply setting the webpage to HTML.
By using the HTML tags and reading the chatper I put the tags in a specific order. </p>

<p>In chapter 1 of Introduction to the Internet and Web Design I learned about HTML tags and how to set my webpage to HTML.
I also learned about what order the HTML tags should be placed in and spacing them out to make it neat.</p>
